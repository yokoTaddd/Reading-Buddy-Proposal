# Reading-Buddy-Proposal
This repository will be based on a new proposal to improve the reading buddy program, digitizing it and making it more effective and user-friendly.
Core Features
    •	 Connected Big Buddy & Little Buddy accounts
Each pair is linked using a unique serial code to ensure correct pairing and privacy.
    •	Vocabulary reinforcement with audio support
Big buddies input words that the little buddy struggled to pronounce during reading sessions.
Little buddies can tap on each word to hear the correct pronunciation and practice independently.
    •	Digital reading log
The app records:
    o	books already read
    o	books currently being read
This replaces paper logs and allows easy progress tracking.
