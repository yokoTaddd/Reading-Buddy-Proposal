# Reading-Buddy-Proposal
This repository contains a project based on a proposal to improve the Reading Buddy program by supporting learning continuity between reading sessions and reducing reliance on paper-based tracking.

Through direct experience in the Reading Buddy program, a key challenge was identified: children often struggle to retain correct pronunciation of words between weekly sessions. This project aims to address that gap with a simple, focused digital tool.

Core Features
1. Connected Big Buddy & Little Buddy Accounts

Each Big Buddy–Little Buddy pair is connected using a unique pairing code. This ensures correct pairing while keeping the system simple and privacy-conscious.

2. Vocabulary Reinforcement with Audio Support

Big buddies record words that the little buddy struggled to pronounce during reading sessions.

Little buddies can tap on each word to hear the correct pronunciation and practice independently.

This allows repeated exposure and reinforcement outside of scheduled sessions.

3. Digital Reading Log

The app maintains a record of:

books already read

books currently being read

This replaces traditional paper reading logs and allows for easier progress tracking across sessions.

Project Goals

Support children’s reading development between weekly Reading Buddy sessions

Improve pronunciation retention through repeated, audio-based practice

Reduce administrative friction caused by paper-based logs

Complement existing Reading Buddy programs without adding extra workload for teachers
